## What is this?
This plugin rolls up your current project's jar and all of its dependencies
into the the layout expected by One-JAR, producing a single runnable
fat-jar, similar to the following:

```
my-awesome-thing-1.2.3-standalone.jar
|
+---- com
|   +---- simontuffs
|       +---- onejar
|           +---- Boot.class
|           +---- (etc., etc.)
|           +---- OneJarURLConnection.class
+---- doc
|   +---- one-jar-license.txt
+---- lib
|   +---- other-cool-lib-1.7.jar
|   +---- some-cool-lib-2.5.jar
+---- main
|   +-- main.jar
+---- META-INF
|   +---- MANIFEST.MF
+---- OneJar.class
+---- .version
```

You can read more about the layout of a One-JAR archive from the official site
[here](http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/).

## Quick Start
First, you'll want to add the plugin to your build, as in:
```groovy

apply plugin: 'gradle-one-jar'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.rholder:gradle-one-jar:1.0.4'
    }
}
```

Then, at a minimum, the configuration expects to find a custom 'mainClass' when
adding your own task, as in:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
}
```

Then you can run the task with:

```bash
gradle awesomeFunJar
```

The end result will be a new build artifact with the `standalone` classifier
that should be suitable for publishing to a repository, etc. via:

```groovy
artifacts {
    archives awesomeFunJar
}
```

If you don't like the name of the final artifact, you can change it just like
any other Gradle `Jar` task with:
```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    archiveName = 'koala.jar'
}
```

## Advanced Features
The current incarnation of the `gradle-one-jar` plugin exists as a highly
configurable Gradle task implementation built as an extension of the built-in
`Jar` task. The following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more advanced
features that the plugin can perform to meet the varying needs of deploying
standardized artifacts.

### Selectable One-JAR version
By default, the `one-jar-boot` version used is the stable
`one-jar-boot-0.97.jar` which is available from the One-JAR homepage (last
updated 2012-08-15). However, if you'd prefer to use the latest development
version `one-jar-boot-0.98.jar` (last updated 2010-08-25) then you can do so
with the following:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    useStable = false
}
```

### Bring your own One-JAR version
You can also use your own customized version of a `one-jar-boot` jar by using
the oneJarConfiguration setting, as in the following that assumes your root
project directory contains the jar at
`custom-boot/one-jar-boot-0.97.2-custom.jar`:

```groovy
configurations {
    oneJarLib
}

dependencies {
    oneJarLib files('custom-boot/one-jar-boot-0.97.2-custom.jar')
}

task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    useStable = false
    oneJarConfiguration = configurations.oneJarLib
}
```

### Use custom configuration for dependencies
By default, the plugin uses the current project's `runtime` configuration to
resolve which dependencies are to be included in the final One-JAR archive. If
you would rather use your own custom configuration, you can set it as follows in
the task:

```groovy
// add your own configuration
configurations {
    fatJarBuild
}

// declare dependencies for this configuration
dependencies {
    // only for compile
    compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.2'

    // dependencies in fat jar
    fatJarBuild 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.2'
    fatJarBuild 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.2'
}

// override target configuration
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    targetConfiguration = configurations.fatJarBuild
}
```

### Custom MANIFEST.MF entries
By default, the MANIFEST.MF added to the final One-JAR archive contains only the
bare minimum number of attributes expected for `one-jar-boot` to behave
correctly.  You can add your own custom attributes to the `manifest` property of
a `OneJar` task just like a `Jar` task, such as in:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    manifest {
        attributes 'Timestamp': String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis())
        attributes 'ContainsXML': 'No'
    }
}
```

### Merge base `Jar` task MANIFEST.MF entries
If you just want all of the MANIFEST.MF entries that are present in your
project's `Jar` task to be merged with the default entries needed for
`one-jar-boot` in the final archive, then you can do so with:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    mergeManifestFromJar = true
}
```

### Add your own custom root MANIFEST.MF
If you just want total control over the MANIFEST.MF being used in the final
One-JAR archive, you can override the MANIFEST.MF entry and instead provide your
own custom manifest file with the following:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    manifestFile = file('custom/MY-CUSTOM-MANIFEST.MF')
}
```

You should note however, that if you decide to do this, you'll need to provide
the entries that are expected by `one-jar-boot` yourself:

```
Main-Class: com.simontuffs.onejar.Boot
One-Jar-Main-Class: com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain
One-Jar-Show-Expand: false
One-Jar-Confirm-Expand: false
Created-By: rholder
```

### Add native libraries
Files added to the `/binlib` directory within an archive get expanded to a
temporary directory on startup, and the One-JAR JarClassLoader loads them
automatically. To get your own native library files included in your archive,
try something like this:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    binLib = files('libFoo.so')
}
```

### Add any files to the root archive
If you just want to be able to drop arbitrary files into the root of the
generated archive, then you can specify a directory (which will also include its
children) to be copied over the top of the the existing files with:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    additionalDir = file('someDirFilledWithGoodies')
}
```

### Framework ClassLoader customizations
[Spring](http://www.springsource.org/), [Guice](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/),
and even [JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/)'s [FXML](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html)
make certain assumptions about class loading that may not hold when bundling
projects in a One-JAR archive. The workaround for these cases is documented
[here](http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=frameworks). In order to
enable this functionality in the plugin, you can simply add one of the included
factories to the manifest, as in:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    manifest {
        attributes 'One-Jar-URL-Factory': 'com.simontuffs.onejar.JarClassLoader$OneJarURLFactory'
    }
}
```

### Override the base Jar task
By default, the current project's `Jar` task (which is made available when
applying the `java` plugin and exposed as `jar`) is where a `OneJar` task pulls
its raw compiled class and resource information to create the `main/main.jar`
entry in the final One-JAR archive. However, it is possible to override this
default with:

```groovy
task awesomeFunJar(type: OneJar) {
    mainClass = 'com.github.rholder.awesome.MyAwesomeMain'
    baseJar = someOtherJarTask
}
```

I'd consider this experimental functionality. If you find yourself needing to do
this for some reason, you might also consider just setting up a multi-module
Gradle project with a nearly empty One-JAR creator project (which would in turn
create a nearly empty `main/main.jar`). This way you could create One-JAR
archives with custom configurations, mainClass, etc., by simply creating
separate `OneJar` tasks that were dependent on your other modules without
having to worry about customizations for specific independent `Jar`
configurations since they could be made to explicitly include whichever build
was necessary.

## Building from source
The `gradle-one-jar` build plugin uses a [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-based build system. In the instructions
below, [`./gradlew`](http://vimeo.com/34436402) is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build. The only
prerequisites are [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and JDK 1.6+.

### check out sources
`git clone git://github.com/rholder/gradle-one-jar.git`

### compile and test, build all jars
`./gradlew build`

### install all jars into your local Maven cache
`./gradlew install`
